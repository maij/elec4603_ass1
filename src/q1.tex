\subsection*{a)}
The law of mass action is stating that the product of hole concentration and free electron concentration is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, i.e. $n p = n_i^2$, where $n_i$ is a function of temperature.

Therefore, $n_i$ is constant under thermal equilibrium.
\subsection*{b)}
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(E) &= \frac{1}{1+\exp\left(\frac{E-E_F}{k T}\right)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E-E_F}{k T}\right)} \\
&= \exp\left(\frac{E_F - E}{k T}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
when $E - E_F \gg k T$, typically $E - E_F > 3 k T $
\subsection*{c)}
$$n = N_C \exp \left(\frac{E_F - E_C}{k T} \right)$$
$N_C$ is the effective density of states, or the maximum number of electrons if every possible state is occupied.
The exponential term is an application of the Fermi function to the conduction band, implying that some states 
may be filled thermally with low probability.
\subsection*{d)}
$M_C$ and $M_V$ are, respectively, the conduction band minima and valence band maxima. They represent what is depicted on typical band gap diagrams, where the conduction band is a single energy level, which corresponds to $M_C$, and the valence band corresponds to $M_V$. Their values in silicon are $M_C = 1.12$ eV and $M_V = 0$ eV, since the valence band maxima is taken as a reference. %\todo[inline]{Explain this}
