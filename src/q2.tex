For all parts of this question I have assumed $T = 300 \textrm{ K}$ and have used values appropriate for silicon.

\subsection*{b)}
	Under forward-bias, electrons are injected into the n-doped regions, and positive charges, or holes, 
	will be injected into the p-doped region. An electron injected into the n-doped region will feel an electric attraction due to the positive-space charge region and so will accelerate, and be swept into the p-doped region, as a diffusion current. Once in the p-region, it can recombine with a hole, depending on the average diffusion length. Once carriers have recombined, we have reached our initial conditions, and the process will repeat. Due to the recombination current, more current will be drawn from the applied voltage source. A similar explanation can be applied to the holes injected into the p-doped region, being swept into the n-doped region. Therefore, the minority carriers define the large portion of the total diode current.
	
	Current density, $J$, can be expressed as $J = -q D \dfrac{d C}{d x}$, where $C$ is the concentration of a particular carrier. It is clear from Figure \ref{fig::concentration} that the majority carriers do not change in concentration by a large degree, but the minority carriers in each region do.

	A plot of the current density is shown in Figure \ref{fig::current}, which portrays the minority carrier current as the main factor of current in a forward-biased diode.

The x' is the depth into the p-doped region, while x is the depth into the n-doped region, both extending from the edge of the depletion region. $J_n$ and $J_p$ represent the minority carrier current densities in the appropriate regions.}

\subsection*{c)}
	Poisson's equation can be expressed as
	$$-\dfrac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = \dfrac{d\hat{E}}{dx} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon} %= \frac{q}{\epsilon}(p - n + N^{+}_D - N^{-}_A)
	$$
	
	If we assume the depletion approximation, the electric field will be confined to the transition region of the pn junction. $\rho$ is the charge carrier density, and is assumed to be constant throughout the p doped region, with a value of $q N_A$, and also throughout the n doped region as $q N_D$.
	
	Therefore, for $x_p \le x < 0$, we can solve
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
		\dfrac{d\hat{E}}{dx} &= -\frac{q N_A}{\epsilon} \\
					\hat{E}	 &= -\frac{q N_A}{\epsilon} x + c
	\end{aligned}
	\]
	Applying the depletion approximation, and asserting a continuity in electric field $\hat{E}$, we know that $\hat{E} = 0$ when $x = x_p$, noting that $x_p < 0$.
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
		\therefore c &= - \dfrac{q N_A}{\epsilon}\left|x_p\right| \\
		\therefore \hat{E}(x) &= - \dfrac{q N_A}{\epsilon}(\left|x_p\right| + x) \textrm{\hspace{0.5cm} for } x_p \le x < 0
	\end{aligned}
	\]
	Similarly, for the n-doped region,
	$$ \hat{E}(x) = \dfrac{q N_D}{\epsilon}(x -x_n) \textrm{\hspace{0.5cm} for } 0 \le x \le x_n$$

	\end{figure}	
	A plot of this function is shown in Figure \ref{fig::e_field}.
	
	If we integrate again, we can find the built-in potential $\psi_0$.
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
		- \dfrac{d \psi_0}{dx} &= \hat{E} \\
		\psi_0 &= - \int_{x_p}^{x_n} \hat{E} dx \\
			   &= 
			   \int_{x_p}^{0} \frac{q N_A}{\epsilon} (\left|x_p\right|+x) dx 
			   - \int_{0}^{x_n} \frac{q N_D}{\epsilon} (x - x_n) dx \\
			   &= \dfrac{q N_A}{2 \epsilon} x_p^2 + \dfrac{q N_D}{2 \epsilon} x_n^2 \\
			   &= 0.973 \textrm{ V}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
	
	A plot of the built-in potential as a function of space is shown in Figure \ref{fig::built_in}.
